    Conditional reasoning, a crucial component of human cognition, often involves interpreting "if-then" scenarios in ways that surpass their literal, logical meanings. Take the statement "If you mow the lawn, you will receive five dollars" Logically, this holds true even if one gets five dollars for a different task, but people usually interpret it as "Only if you mow the lawn, you will receive five dollars." This is known as Conditional Perfection.This pattern of adding meaning to conditional statements reflects our general skill in drawing pragmatic inferences from language. We frequently understand utterances more deeply than their explicit content suggests. For example, "Mary had cheesecake for dessert" often implies she had only cheesecake, and "I ate some of your cookies" suggests I didn't eat all of them. We make these inferences swiftly during real-time language processing. This project investigates whether people in conditional reasoning initially adopt a non-logical, pragmatic interpretation or begin with a logical view and then shift to a more nuanced understanding. By examining how we process conditional statements and enrich literal language, we contribute the interplay between human cognition and language comprehension.

<h4 style="margin:0 0 0;">Pronoun Resolution in Turkish*</h4>

In natural communication settings, ambiguous referring expressions like 'she', 'that', 'there', 'then' are rarely encountered without context. They usually appear after a meaningful discourse, enabling the construction of plausible hypotheses about their reference. Even within coherent discourse, identifying the correct reference among multiple alternatives is complex, involving understanding who or what the utterance is about, the event, the participants and their roles, and the relationship of the utterance to other discourse elements.

Specifically focusing on Turkish, this project examines how null and overt pronouns are interpreted across different verb types, coherence relations, valency, and word order. Turkish null-pronouns show a complex interplay between grammatical and pragmatic factors, while overt-pronouns are heavily influenced by grammatical factors.
