Hi there!

I'm Ebru Evcen, a Ph.D. candidate in Linguistics at the University of California, San Diego. I am a member of [Language & Development Lab](https://ladlab.ucsd.edu), where I am advised by David Barner. 

My research primarily focuses on psycholinguistics and experimental pragmatics. Specifically, I explore how we incrementally build mental representations of events as language unfolds, and I'm intrigued by the process through which listeners develop nuanced linguistic meanings during comprehension. Using behavioral methods, I investigate how we arrive at interpretations of utterances that are much richer than what is literally said. 

I am also associated with the [Language and Cognition Lab](https://ladlab.ucsd.edu) at Central European University (Vienna, Austria), where I work under the supervision of Eva Wittenberg.

Before my Ph.D., I earned a master's degree in English Language Teaching from the Middle East Technical University (Ankara, Turkey), where I was part of the [Language and Cognitive Development Lab](https://langcog.metu.edu.tr), led by Duygu Ã–zge.
