Hi there!

I'm Ebru Evcen, a Ph.D. candidate in Linguistics at the University of California, San Diego. I spend most of my days either puzzling over how people build meaning or chasing toddlers around with games in the name of science.

I am a member of Language & Development Lab, where I work with [David Barner](https://ladlab.ucsd.edu). My research is about language and cognition, approached through experimental semantics and pragmatics with a focus on development. I’m interested in how meaning is represented in the mind, how people construct meanings during comprehension, how these meanings are enriched by context, and how children learn to integrate both linguistic knowledge and contextual cues.

I study how language guides this reasoning in domains such as conditional reasoning, disjunction, and other logical expressions that give rise to different kinds of inferences. In these cases, listeners must generate inferences, consider alternatives, and evaluate what counts as a relevant contribution in the conversational context. More broadly, I explore the interface between language and communication, focusing on how linguistic decoding and pragmatic inference interact during comprehension and how these processes change over development.

Previously, I worked with [Eva Wittenberg](https://lcl.ceu.edu) (formerly at UC San Diego, now at Central European University) on collaborative projects, and with [Duygu Sarısoy](https://langcog.metu.edu.tr) during my MA at Middle East Technical University.

My CV can be found <a href="https://ebruevcen.github.io/files/EbruEvcen_CV.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>, while I can be found in San Diego coffee shops, trying to look productive with my laptop (and sometimes succeeding!)
