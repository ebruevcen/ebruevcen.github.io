Hi there!

I'm Ebru Evcen, a Ph.D. candidate in Linguistics at the University of California, San Diego. I am a member of [Language & Development Lab](https://ladlab.ucsd.edu), where I work with David Barner. 

My research is about language and cognition, and I approach this through experimental semantics and pragmatics, with a particular focus on development. I’m interested in how meaning is represented in the mind, how context shapes interpretation, and how children acquire the capacity to use language for reasoning. By combining experimental methods with theoretical insights, I study how people construct meanings during comprehension, how these meanings are enriched by context, and how children learn to integrate both linguistic knowledge and contextual cues.

A central part of my work examines how linguistic structures support logical and pragmatic inference. Humans routinely arrive at interpretations that are richer than what is literally said, drawing pragmatic inferences that unfold rapidly during real-time processing. study how language guides this reasoning in cases such as conditional and causal statements, disjunction, and other logical expressions, where listeners must generate inferences, consider alternatives, and evaluate what counts as a relevant contribution in the conversational context. More broadly, I explore the interface between language and communication, focusing on how linguistic decoding and pragmatic inference interact during comprehension and how these processes change over development.

Previously, I worked with [Eva Wittenberg](https://lcl.ceu.edu) (formerly at UC San Diego, now at Central European University) on collaborative projects, and with [Duygu Sarısoy](https://langcog.metu.edu.tr) during my MA at Middle East Technical University.
