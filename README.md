Hi there!

I'm Ebru Evcen, a Ph.D. candidate in Linguistics at the University of California, San Diego. I am a member of Language & Development Lab, where I am advised by David Barner.

My research primarily focuses on psycholinguistics and experimental pragmatics. Specifically, I'm interested in how adults and kids develop rich linguistic meanings during comprehension. Using behavioral methods, I investigate how we arrive at interpretations of utterances that go beyond what is literally said.

I am also associated with the Language and Cognition Lab at Central European University (Vienna, Austria), where I work with Eva Wittenberg.

Before my Ph.D., I earned a master's degree in English Language Teaching from the Middle East Technical University (Ankara, Turkey), where I was part of the Language and Cognitive Development Lab, led by Duygu Ã–zge.
